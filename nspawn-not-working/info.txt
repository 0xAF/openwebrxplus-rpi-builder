This method will not work, because we cannot use loop-devices (losetup) in the
container. The kernel will create the loop-device in the host, but the
container cannot know about it (unless restarted).
Perhaps someday, when the loop-devices have the right kernel interface to
virtualize then for containers, this could work.
